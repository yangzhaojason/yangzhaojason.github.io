### 👋 About Me
I am currently a PhD student at the **School of Artificial Intelligence, Xi'an Jiaotong University**, advised by **Prof. Liu**.  
My research focuses on **world-model-centric Embodied AI**, **Autonomous Driving**, and **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models.  
I previously worked as a senior/lead researcher at Baidu Apollo, Alibaba DAMO Academy, and Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab.

My long-term goal is to build **general-purpose autonomous agents** capable of robust long-horizon reasoning and real-world deployment.
